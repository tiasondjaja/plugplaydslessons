(2) From the visualization, and by computing the correlation coefficient between the variables `duration` and `waiting`, we determine that a line is a reasonable type of model.  We then find a line of best fit (one that minimizes MSE).  Assuming that this model is reasonable, we can use the model to predict when the next eruption will take place, given the duration of an eruption that just took place.\n",

        "In our running example above, we assessed the performance of our simple decision tree classifier, which we implemented as the function `predict_cancer_class()`.  Recall that we built this classifier based on a pattern that we observed: When we create a scatterplot that visualizes the uniformity of cell size and clump thickness variables, tumors that are benign tend to cluster at low values of uniformity of cell size and clump thickness.  We can try to improve our model by creating other decision tree classifiers based on similar observations of other variables in this dataset (as you will do in Exercise 2 below).\n",

        "We can also consider other types of classifiers.  In this last part of our lesson, we will discuss the k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier.  The idea behind this classifier is simple:  Given a new tumor data point that we want to predict to be either benign or malignant, we might try to look for data points in our training set (which we know to be benign or malignant) whose variable values are as near as possible to those of the new data point.  If the majority of these nearby points are malignant, then we predict the new data point to be from a malignant tumor as well; similarly, if the majority of nearby points are benign, we predict the new data point to be from a benign tumor.\n",
