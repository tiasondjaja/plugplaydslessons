## Context

I taught the pilot of the course "Quantitative Reasoning: From Data to Discovery" (NYU Core UA 111) in Fall 2018.  The course is centered around how we use data to build models and how we interpret the outputs of quantitative methods and models. The main goal of the course is not to train future mathematicians or data scientists, although we would be more than excited if many of the students taking this course is inspired to take further quantitative courses or to major in these fields.  Rather, the course aims to develop students' skills and confidence in quantitative reasoning and to help them be well-informed citizens and consumers of data and technology.
